  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // strings is a primitive datatype, so immutable
    // it a copy 'by value', meens a new reference to
    // another memory area is created, and the value
    // of the initial string is affected to this reference
    let s1 = 'Hey !';

    let s2 = s1;

    s2 = s1 + ' How are you ?';

    console.log(s1);
    console.log(s2);

    // this behavior is the same for all primitive datatype
    // all immutable in Javascript:
    // String, Number, Boolean, Undefined
    // Null, BigInt, Symbol (new in ES6)


    // Let's say we have an array
    // Array are Objects, and all Objects are mutable
    // when copying Objects, it is a copy by reference
    // meen the two variable point to the same memory area
    // when we log the Array we see the prototypal chain
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let players2 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //players2.push('ooooh noooo');

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // I like this one
    players2 = Array.from(players);
    // take care, Array.of will make [players]
    players2.push('ooooh noooo');
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // I like this one also
    players2 = [...players];
    players2.push('ooooh noooo');
    console.log(players);
    console.log(players2);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const bob = person;

    //person.name = 'Bob';

    //console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // this is available in ES6
    const bob = Object.assign({}, person);
    bob.name = 'Bob';
    console.log(person);
    console.log(bob);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // This would be nice: 
    // bob = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // let's create an object with nested objects
    const awe = {
      name: 'Awe',
      age: 30,
      hobbies: {
        sport: 'surfing',
        art: 'guitar'
      }
    }

    //const bill = Object.assign({}, awe);

    //bill.hobbies.sport = 'IT';

    // oh noooo, awe is less awesome now, his sport is IT !!!
    //console.log(awe);

    // I have to check why this "Poor man's deep copy"
    // is not recommended. Maybe performances issues ? To check
    const bill = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(awe));

    bill.sport = 'IT';

    console.log(bill);

    console.log(awe);
