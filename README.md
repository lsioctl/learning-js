# learning-js

## TODO 

* Promises
** reject, error propagation
** read again YDJS on this
** link with Monades

* Design Patterns
** generic from GoF
** specific to JS

* CSS, pure or frameworks
** example with web components

* Console
** log may not be synchronous (had issue, and to read in YDJS)
** console.test

* Testing

* Playing with WebSockets
** Notepad like ?
** use it with Mario game for multiplayer ?

* Frameworks
** Vue
** Stencil

* Webpack
** Node Module system
** sourcemap
** live reload
** lazy loading
** babel

* Timezones
** why people fights with eg moment.js and TZ data, knowing TZ datas are already
on the client side (handled by the OS)

* Storage
** session storage

* Reactive Programming
* Rx.js

* SPAs
** lazy load (certainly to be seen in WebPack)
** how render them for bots other than Google
(example maybe with Lambda@Edge, APIgateways, ...)

* PWAs


## Seen 

* closures
** as a cache (crypto challenge in codewars)
** debounce function
* const, let, var
* console dir, log, error
* async, await
* web components
** basics
* fetch API
** basics
* modules
** using IIFE modules to avoid having a local webserver
** ES6 modules (needs CORS and so HTTP dev server)
* Storage
** local storage
